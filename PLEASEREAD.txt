Github link to pages implementation: https://github.com/rjrasizer/rasizer-website
Website url from github: https://rjrasizer.github.io/rasizer-website/index.html

Important notes: Had to move everything into docs to get the github pages implementation to work.
Also had to move resources to within docs for pages implementation.
Needed to rename home.html to index.html in order for pages to read the right home file.
